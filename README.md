# Simple Pokemon App using Graphql API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project fetches its data from https://graphql-pokeapi.vercel.app/api/graphql 

This app lists a limited amount of Pokemon, whereas you can see their details and also catch and give nicknames to them. You can then see how many Pokemons you have in a page dedicated to it.
